The most important thing is not to come up with a solution, but to know how to solve problems in multiple ways. 
In this repo, there will be problems in these topics 
1. Data Structures
    - Array
    - Linked List
    - Graph & Tree
    - Stack & Queue
    - Heap

2. Search algorithms 
    - Search Algorithms
    - Sort algorithms
    - Graph theory (shortest path, minimal tree)
    - Back-Tracking 
    - BFS, DFS 
    - Dynamic Programming
    - Hash Table.

### Notes
1. How to do Leetcode Questions efficiently - You might want to go through these questions multiple times. Also, make a reachable plan - start from small number of easy questions.
Consistency matters.    
    - Try to think first. If there's no luck, go check out the discussion section. 
    - At the beginning, try to use an IDE to get the correct result. Then, rewrite the program on the website to enhance memory. As time goes along, you will get more comfortable with the syntax. 
    - Make a quick summary in each directory's readme.
