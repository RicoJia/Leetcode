### Time 30 min

### Method 1 Binary Search
Find the element that is smaller than the previous one. O(lg(n))


### Method 2 divide and conquer 
Find the smallest element. O(n) 
I will implement this method as this is more interesting :)

### Implementation notes: 
Shame on me: I set the recursion wrong again!! Calling the wrong function!
