This Question is tricky. I am using Manacher's algorithm, which is o(n) in the best case, and o(n2) in the worst case. 
However, tricky parts are: 
1. odd palindrome "aba" and even palindrome "abba" are both valid. 
2. single character "s" can be a palindrome as well

A new trick that I learned is the generalized lambda expression, introduced in C++14.
