### Time 20 min

### Method 1 - One pass, append to the tail of a. 
We copy the largest values of a, b to the tail of a. Let p = number of b elements copied to the tail of a; q is number of a elements copied to the tail of a; 
l be the number of a elements overwriten during this process. 

We can prove that l <  q thru n + l = p + q.
