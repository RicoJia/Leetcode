### Time 40 min

### Method 1 - Merge Sort with S(n) Space complexity
Divide and conquer. Then use use an extra copy for returning the vector. 

### Method 2 - In place Merge sort with O(n^2) complexity


### Method 3 - Advanced in place merge sort O(n) Complexity
Not being implemented at this moment. Good for a future project.  

### Notes
Pay attention to the repeating ones.
