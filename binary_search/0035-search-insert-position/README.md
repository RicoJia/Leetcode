This is a typical binary sort problem. You have upper bound, and lower bound. 
This time, I will try to use a while loop. 

### Notes
**MIND BLOWING: recursion is slower than its iteration equivalent, or less optimal iteration equivalent!**
my old code: simply iterating thru all members is even faster than my recursive method!!!
This is because you need to create a new stack frame for recursion, which involves a lot more instructions than recursion.
